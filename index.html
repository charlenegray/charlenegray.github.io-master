   <p>Bonjour! My name is Char and Iâ€™m currently a senior at Eastern Washington University. I am majoring in Technical Communication with 2 minors: VCD and Communications. I draw inspiration from adventures, vintage, and nature. Outside of design I am a babysitter, as well as a combine driver for the family farm during harvest. With my spare time I enjoy playing guitar, quilting, and photography. FUN FACT: I won an XBOX in a coloring contest when I was 6!</p>
